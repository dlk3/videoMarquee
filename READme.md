## Generating A Scrolling Text Marquee As A Video

I wanted to test the performance of a video marquee vs one created using
CSS and HTML.  Turned out that the performance was about the same but I
wanted to save my work anyway.

Here's a sample marquee video generated by videoMarquee:

<video playsinline autoplay loop muted width="100%">
  <source src="https://github.com/dlk3/videoMarquee/blob/master/sample.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
